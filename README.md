# Alhc-Week-5-Challenge

## Description
    This README generator is something I created to make it easier to generate future README files. This project was almost completely NPM and Inquirer based. 
    I learned a lot about using the integrated terminal and using things like NPM and Inquirer. 

## Installation
    You'll need to clone this repo, install node.js, run the npm install command to install the appropriate Inquirer version.

## Usage
    This is the link to the video demonstration of my project [(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZuonALGuMuYp3Zo5BjUP4wD4PGL4qy3V/view)]

## Credits
    Inquirer version 8.2.4
